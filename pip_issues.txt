error: metadata-generation-failed

× Encountered error while generating package metadata.
╰─> pandas

note: This is an issue with the package mentioned above, not pip.


FIX: Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 (not 3.14). Pandas has no wheels for Python 3.14,
so pip builds from source and the build fails (Cython/C++ compatibility).  # Conda: create env with supported Python, then install
  conda create -n da-copilot python=3.12 -y
  conda activate da-copilot
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  # Or venv with system Python 3.12 if installed
  python3.12 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt

# compatibility issues with current langchain config

ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.

Summary of what was changed:
Cause
After pinning langchain-core<2, the installed langgraph version may no longer export START and END from langgraph.graph, which leads to an import error on that line.
Change
START and END were replaced with the string literals LangGraph uses internally: "__start__" and "__end__". Only StateGraph is imported from langgraph.graph, so the import no longer depends on START/END being available.
Files updated
streamlit_app.py – from langgraph.graph import StateGraph only; edges use "__start__" and "__end__".
langgraph_code_agent.py – Same import and edge updates.
graph_workflow.py – from langgraph.graph import StateGraph only; all END usages replaced with "__end__".
You can run the app again; the previous import error for StateGraph, START, END should be gone. If you still see an error (e.g. No module named 'langgraph'), install the package in your environment:
